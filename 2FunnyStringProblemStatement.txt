All submissions for this problem are available.In this challenge, 
you will determine whether a string is funny or not. To determine 
whether a string is funny, create a copy of the string in reverse 
e.g. abc -> cba. Iterating through each string, compare the absolute 
difference in the ascii values of the characters at 
positions 0 and 1, 1 and 2 and so on to the end. 
If the list of absolute differences is the same for both strings, 
they are funny.
Determine whether a give string is funny. If it is, return Funny, 
otherwise return Not Funny. For example, given the string s = lmnop, 
the ordinal values of the charcters are [108,109,110,111,112]. 
sreverse = ponml and the ordinals are [112,111,110,109,108]. 
The absolute differences of the adjacent elements for both strings are 
[1,1,1,1], so the answer is Funny.

Function Description:

Complete the funnyString function in the editor below. 
For each test case, it should return a string, 
either Funny or Not Funny. 
funnyString has the following parameter(s): • s: a string to test

Input Format

The first line contains an integer q, the number of queries. 
The next q lines each contain a string,s .

Constraints

• 1 <= q <= 10

• 2<= |s| <= 1000

Output Format:

For each string print whether it is Funny or Not Funny on a new line.

Sample Input:

2

acxz

bcxz

Sample Output:

Funny

Not Funny

Explanation:

You can use r to store the reverse of s.

Test Case 0:

S = acxz , r = zxca Corresponding ASCII values of characters of the strings: 
s = [97,99,120,122] and r = [122,120,99,97] 
For both the strings the adjacent difference list is [2, 21, 2] so we print Funny.

Test Case 1:

S = bcxz, r = zxcb Corresponding ASCII values of characters of the strings: 
s = [98,99,120,122] and r = [122,120,99,98] 
The adjacent difference list for string s is [1, 21, 2] and for 
string r it is [2, 21, 1]. Since they are not the same we print Not Funny.
